# Notes for Jeremy Howard's Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 1
In this series of posts, I intend to highlight the important parts that I came across in Jeremy Howards ML book. He wrote the book to accompany the online course 'Practical Deep Learning for Coders' that is posted on [course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) page.

My posts will not address every aspect of what is covered in the book but will rather aim to highlight those that I think are either interesting or worth paying close attention to.
