# Notes for Jeremy Howard's Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 1
In this series of posts, I intend to highlight the important parts that I came across in Jeremy Howards ML book. He mainly wrote the book to accompany the online course 'Practical Deep Learning for Coders' that is posted on course.fast.ai page.

My posts will not address every aspect of what is covered and will rather aim to highlight those that I think are either interesting or of consequence.
